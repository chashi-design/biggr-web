    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      This app stores training logs, favorite exercises, and settings (e.g., weight unit).
      When iCloud sync is available, these data are also stored in Apple iCloud (CloudKit private database).
      Data stored in iCloud is handled in accordance with Apple’s privacy policy.
      We do not collect personally identifiable information such as names or email addresses.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Purpose of Use and Storage</h2>
    <p>
      The training logs you enter are used only for recording, viewing, and analysis within the app.
      The data is stored on your device or in iCloud and is not sent to any developer-operated server.
      The developer does not access data stored in iCloud.
      iCloud sync can be enabled or disabled in device iCloud settings. When disabled, data is stored only on the device and may be lost if the app is deleted or the device is changed.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      This app may use App Store Connect App Analytics to view aggregated, anonymous information
      such as installs, usage, and crashes.
      These data are aggregated by Apple, and the developer does not receive personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      For iCloud sync, data is stored in Apple iCloud/CloudKit.
      We do not share your training logs with any third parties other than Apple.
    </p>
